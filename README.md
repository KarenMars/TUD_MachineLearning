## CS4220 Machine Learning 1
In this course, it gives a broad introduction of machine learning, which covers regression and classification tasks, evaluation methods of machine learning algorithm, and a series of methods which try to boost the performance of machine learning algorithm. An overview of this lecture is shown in this [graph](). 

One of the main goal of this lecture is to raise reflection of machine learning algorithms in those following aspects:
- How to compare & choose different classifiers or regressor? 
    - How will they perform with different size of training data?
    - How will they perform with different dimensions of features?
- What is a general process of design a machine learning algorithm to fit our problem?
    - The inference stage 
    - The decision stage


[prtools](https://github.com/DMJTax/prtools) is required to installed for exercises. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) can be used for these exercises as well.
