# TUD_MachineLearning

This repo contains various master courses in Tu Delft related to machine learning. These courses include **CS4220 Machine Learning 1**, **EE4685 Machine Learning, a Bayesian Perspective**. Exercises, course notes are also covered in this repo for further reference. 

## CS4220 Machine Learning 1
In this course, it gives a broad introduction of machine learning, which covers regression and classification tasks, evaluation methods of machine learning algorithm, and a series of methods which try to boost the performance of machine learning algorithm. An overview of this lecture is shown in the graph below.

One of the main goal of this lecture is to raise reflection of machine learning algorithms in those following aspects:
- How to compare & choose different classifiers or regressor? 
    - How will they perform with different size of training data?
    - How will they perform with different dimensions of features?
- What is a general process of design a machine learning algorithm to fit our problem?
    - The inference stage 
    - The decision stage


[prtools](https://github.com/DMJTax/prtools) is required to installed for exercises. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) can be used for these exercises as well.
